### ðŸ”¥ Responsive Portfolio Website

The project I clone from [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bedimcode) and website template: [Responsive Portfolio Website](https://youtu.be/oy8dSsK57Ps?si=UWH4TFBhJvAQCxwj).

Note: The actual project was build with raw CSS code while I used the CSS prepocessor language [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) to build the site.

- Responsive Portfolio Website Using HTML CSS & JavaScript
- Smooth scrolling in each section.
- Includes a dark and light mode.
- Developed first with the Mobile First methodology, then for desktop.
- Compatible with all mobile devices and with a beautiful and pleasant user interface.
